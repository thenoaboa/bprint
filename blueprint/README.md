# Blueprint Interactive Viewer

## Overview
Blueprint Interactive Viewer is a dynamic tool designed to revolutionize the way blueprints and detailed schematics are interacted with and understood. Developed by Merced and Noah, this application allows users to upload images of blueprints or items, providing a user-friendly interface to place interactive buttons on various parts of the uploaded image.
